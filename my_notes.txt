Steps of data analysis:

1. Why do we need to use data analysis?
	-In our situation we need to use data analysis for the purpose of being able to predict a value for any house.
2. Collect data.
	-Data we would need are the essentials that affect house prices; in my eyes these would be:
	-Amount of Bathrooms
	-Waterfronts
	-Amount of bedrooms
	-Square footage
	-House condition
	-Floors
	-A good view
	-basement size
	-year built
	-year renovated
3.Clean the data.
	-Standardize Headers
	-Data Types
	-Check for duplicats
	-Null Values
		-Data.isna().sum()
		-Data.info()
	-Checking unique values for cat columns
	-Make sure that numericals are finite numbers
4. Analyze the data.
	-Get scores, make sure there's nothing that stands out.
	-Make extra models to get a better score
		-This would include things I didnt include before
			-Such as lat, long, zipcode
5. Analyze results.


Questions:

Question:
	How would a model know if a lat, long is a good area or a bad area; as well as zipcode?
		-Is my method of measuring correlations valid?

Response:
	Create a model with and without lat, long, and zipcode; With that we will be able to determine if those measures actually make a difference.


Question:
	Why are bedrooms, bathrooms considered categorical?
(SQL Queries questions)

Response:
	To some degree they can be, it would be good to make models with them as categorical and another as numerical.

Question:	
	There is a repeating sell for id 2147483647, is this okay?
		-Its actually half the dataset, 16079 more specifically.
(SQL Query in MySQL, specifically #8 for reference)

Response:
	Had to use bigint when importing data, the repeating number was SQL's int limit.


Question:
	Is making an Age column redundant, and if so would it be better to replace the year_built column with age in years instead?

Response:
	This is called feature extraction. Delete the column of year_built after making an age column.


Question:
	What is the point of making a readme.md in this situation? And what do readmes usually contain?
	
Response:
	Describe what my repo is about and what it does.

Question:
	Am I supposed to be getting null values with my calculated field?
TableAu Problem 7

Response:
	This was just caused by a lack of an else in my conditionals.
